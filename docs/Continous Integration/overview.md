# Overview

This comprehensive guide will provide you with all the information you need to effectively set up and manage your remote development environment. 

## Continuous Integration with Jenkins

In our platform, we have chosen Jenkins as the continuous integration tool due to its flexibility and vast range of plugins. Jenkins will play a crucial role in automating the deployment process and managing the state of the infrastructure. 

## GitOps Principles

We strongly adhere to the GitOps principles in our workflow. All our infrastructure-as-code (IaC) code is stored in GitHub repositories. When changes are pushed to the repositories, Jenkins is triggered to create or modify the state of the infrastructure accordingly. This ensures a streamlined and efficient development process, where infrastructure changes are version-controlled and automatically applied.

Throughout this documentation, you will find step-by-step instructions, best practices, and tips for utilizing Jenkins and following the GitOps principles to maximize the effectiveness and productivity of your remote development environment. Let's get started!
